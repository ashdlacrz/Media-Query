    <h1>Women with Baskets</h1>
    <h2>Made by Anita Magsaysay-Ho</h2>
    <p>Anita Magsaysay-Ho was a prominent and significant artist from the Philippines who supported the growth of modern art and neorealism in her nation.
        She was born in Manila in 1914 and later pursued studies at the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts under the tutelage of famed Filipino 
        painters Fernando Amorsolo and Fabian de la Rosa. She later made a trip to the United States where she attended the Art Students League in New York as 
        well as the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan. She and her contemporaries rebelled against the restraints of the earlier, more traditional creative 
        styles in the 1950s, along with other renowned Filipino painters of the Modern Art era, such as Vicente Manansala and Fernando Zobel. As she experimented
        with cubist distortion and a more stylized aspect, her paintings matured and leaned more towards modernism. She was the sole female member of the
        "Thirteen Moderns," a collection of Filipino Modernists. Her life's work constantly honored and was inspired by strong, attractive Philippine women going
        about their daily chores like harvesting crops, washing clothing, and preparing meals for their family. She acknowledged her deep respect for the Philippine
        ladies she showed in her artwork </p>
